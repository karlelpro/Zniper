# Zniper
Great Minecraft hacking tools [All In One]

What is Zniper?
Zniper is a very usefull Minecraft hacking tools such as scanning ports, subdomains, domains, ip range and scanning ip. Maybe in the future (if I can) I will be adding more features. I have many ideas but I just need to know how to make it possible...

ToS:
This ToS is already on the Zniper.py selecting the option nÂ°6 but I don't care.
You can edit all you want from Zniper tool, but you CAN'T distribute your version (edited) unless you leave some info telling that originaly it was made by me (Bart0)
If you see some problems don't contact me directly, first see if you installed all correctly and then if it's all correct you can contact me. BUT if you edited Zniper and there's some errors then don't contact me, it's not my fault :)
