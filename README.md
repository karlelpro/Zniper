# Zniper
Great Minecraft hacking tools [All In One]

What is Zniper?
Zniper is a very usefull Minecraft hacking tools such as scanning ports, subdomains, domains, ip range and scanning ip. Maybe in the future (if I can) I will be adding more features. I have many ideas but I just need to know how to make it possible...

Why Zniper?
If you want to grief servers but you don't know how to start, which tools to use, clients, etc then use Zniper. Zniper will help you to discover ports, subdomains, get staff names, and some grief commands. In future versions I will add grief tutorials and things like that :3

Linux:
1) git clone https://github.com/karlelpro/Zniper.git

Windows:
